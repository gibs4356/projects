Great use of comments to label what each section was doing, as well as using white space to indicate code which was describing an object or function which had not been resolved yet. At times, the white space felt a little excessive (line breaks) and I felt that it wasted space that could be better filled with code or comments. There were several errors in your code which needed to be resolved. When you declared win1, the line defining the title was missing a comma. Also, the title was stored within double quotes. Titanium stores strings in single 	quotes. You also had a syntax error when you were declaring the camera event listener. Good job adding the error argument, I don’t think that was in the book, but there needed to be a semicolon after the function declaration, as well as at the end of the entire statement. Great use of comments, and although I mentioned that there was excessive white space in places, it would have been nice to see more line breaks to distinguish separate parts of the code. Lastly, it’s always helpful to use descriptive variable names, rather than generic ones. It becomes much easier to read code that has hundreds of variables if each one is descriptive!
